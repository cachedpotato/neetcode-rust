# WELCOME

This repo contains my solutions for neetcode problems in rust.
I Have Python and C++ versions as well. I should be merging them all really...

If anyone's wondering why I'm insistent on using `for_each` or `map` instead of for loops, I'm just simply practicing functional programming. I understand that's not what functional programming is really about, but I'm hoping I'll at least get used to the syntax, or just how it looks in general.


## Why make crates for every single problem?
I guess I __can__ just create .rs file per question, but the rust analyzer seems to only work if I have a full crate set up. Yeah that's the only reason.
